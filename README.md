## Results

The Coq formalization of our core language and its soundness theorem are included in the "proof" subdirectory.

## Benchmarks

- Details about the `14` benchmarks used in our evaluation are given in individual folders with the same name as the benchmark; these folders are all located under "benchmarks".
Each benchmark has a file `prog.ml` that presents the source code of the input test generator and a file `ty.ml` that defines the coverage type coverage type we want to check the generator implementation against and the coverage types of various library functions (notated with `[@library]`) used by the implementation. For example, there are three coverage types in `RedBlackTree\ty.ml`: two types that have name `int_gen` and `bool_gen` which are the types of primitive generators used by the implementation, and one type named `rbtree_gen` which is the type we want to check with the `rbtree_gen` program in `RedBlackTree\prog.ml`.

- The directory `synthesizer_input` contains the input specification files for the `5` benchmarks for which we synthesized generators (shown in Figure 9). For E.g. the file `synthesizer_input\sizedBST.spec` is passed to the synthesizer as input.

- The outputs generated by the synthesizer (containing multiple generators) are present in the formatted directories `_synth_<benchmark_name>\prog.ml`. E.g. the file `\benchmarks\_synth_sizedbst\prog.ml` contains the output of running the synthesizer on the file `synthesizer_input\sizedBST.spec`
